A "/etc/my.cnf" from another install may interfere with a Homebrew-built
server starting up correctly.

To connect:
    /usr/local/opt/mysql55/bin/mysql -uroot

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.

Conflicts with mysql, mariadb, percona-server, mysql-cluster, etc.

Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your
own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your
build variables:

    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/mysql55/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/mysql55/include


To have launchd start homebrew/versions/mysql55 at login:
  ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mysql55/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load homebrew/versions/mysql55 now:
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql55.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
  /usr/local/opt/mysql55/bin/mysql.server start
